# Anisa (BETA)

a soon-to-be awful site that collects nikke information from other sites

as i start to take this game more seriously i have a tiresome experience looking at like 5+ sites

"so make your own solution to this made up problem" i thought to myself

this site builds itself and deploys itself everyday, at 00:00 UTC time<br>
there will be times where it fails so dont quote me on that, thanks

that is in place to make sure that the info is up-to-date.<br>
but then again the sites below could just block me /shrug
