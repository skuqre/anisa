...A disappointment.

One of the first Summer units we've gotten and Elysion never fails to disappoint. ||What's up with Elysion being this "soldier" part of Nikke, wanting to be high-class but having the WORST units in game???|| It's not worth to invest in her, because she's THAT bad.

She only has like one usage, being a Water unit for some Solo Raid units. But then again, [Ludmilla: Winter Owner](/anisa/nikke/ludmilla-winter-owner) exists!
