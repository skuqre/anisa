Red Hood is a different beast. (pun intended)

She's literally a game-changing unit -- adding a new mechanic where she can burst at any stage, creating more possible strategies and team compositions.

However though, these skills come with only **one timer**, meaning their timers are shared. She isn't inherently useless when using her as Burst [hex::burst_1] or [hex::burst_2], but rather kinda making her gimmick something like an emergency.

It is greatly recommended to take investment in her; she is basically one of the cheat codes through most forms of content in game. ||Canonically, she's like the 2nd strongest Nikke, next to Liliweiss.||
