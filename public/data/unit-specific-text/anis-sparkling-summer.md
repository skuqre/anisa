Anis's SSR version has arrived!

One of the better limited SSRs this game has to offer. She runs pretty well on her own, but needs some high investment to do tons.
She's a "last-bullet" esque unit, meaning you're gonna have to put her max ammo count **as low as possible**. Like up to 1 possible.

Early team compositions including SAnis (community agreed upon name) may include [Privaty](/anisa/nikke/privaty) in order to reduce her max ammo count.
However, if her Burst Skill is leveled up to more than or equal to 9, team compositions can exclude [Privaty](/anisa/nikke/privaty).

She's a very skill resource hungry unit, but I promise you; she's worth it.
