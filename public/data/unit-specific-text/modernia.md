She seems familiar, doesn't she? ||Marian...||

Welcome Modernia, one of the meta units. She performs exceedingly well on Campaign, Simulation Room, **but not PvP**. She's great against bosses with destroyable projectiles (say, Alteisen's rocket barrage). She's great.

However though, she has bugs specifically with the game. With the FPS issue (she performs worse on lower FPS), she isn't an "all round accessible" Nikke. If you feel like you have a decent device that can handle Nikke at a stable 60 FPS, use her at your will! She will perform best at that situation.

I'll be clear with you, at early story (when I got her first), she's a HUGE carry. She will destroy those stages left and right. If you lack a proper DPS, she is one of the options ever.
