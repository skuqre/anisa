The shotgun buffer! But a sleeper.

The Shotgun meta isn't as meta as meta was. Tove, in a nutshell, is a shotgun buffer. Most of her team compositions include shotgun units that benefit greatly from her kits, but those units aren't really meta right now.

Might as well wait for more better shotgun units. She's also a literal stove. ||Hope to god she doesn't burn her arm next time...||
