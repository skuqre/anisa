For an SR character, Anis is pretty good for early story auto play. She can generate your burst properly, and has a really good kit for the early story content.

However, *she still is an SR*, meaning she'll fall off on the later side of game content. [*But then again, we have a seasonal limited SSR unit of Anis...*](/anisa/nikke/anis-sparkling-summer)
