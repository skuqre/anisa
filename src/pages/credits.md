None of the information you see in this site is by me (I don't know what I'm talking about most of the time). Please head to the respective sites if you'd like some mistakes corrected. There are some information that I (skuqre) have added, however it is very miniscule. If you'd like to correct various warnings (e.g. Limited information, special mechanic information), feel free to [create a pull request/issue on the GitHub](https://github.com/skuqre/anisa).
