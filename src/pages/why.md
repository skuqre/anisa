# Why?

Yeah... true that... *why am I making this*?

Dunno man. The only way to actually imprint information on my mind is to put it into some sort of programming project.
I'm starting to take this game more seriously, I tend to forget a lot of things (and I may have OCD) so programming with said information may just imprint it to my brain.

"Make the solution" I indeed thought to myself. It's funny because it was going to be hard to do.

Here we are now.

*no, it is not my intention to steal site traffic. Never was and never will be.
