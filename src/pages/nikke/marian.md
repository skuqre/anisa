So many roads we could've taken,<br>
but all of them will lead me back to here.<br>
It's funny this thing they call "Destiny",<br>
tried to change it but what's meant to be will be.<br>
<br>
Look up to the sky I can see it all around,<br>
the winds are calling me to come.<br>
They say "It's time to let go,<br>
you won't be alone."<br>
Nothing to fear, I'm right here...<br>
<br>
So goodbye for now,<br>
close your eyes and just believe in me;<br>
I'm always with you inside your heart.<br>
Just so you know!<br>
<br>
I'll find my way back home to you!<br>
<br>
I won't give up!<br>
Like heroes in a final fight.<br>
They may say that this is the end,<br>
but it's just begun!<br>
I will never stop fighting on!<br>
<br>
Barricades may slow the road ahead,<br>
so many battles that we may just have to face.<br>
But you've given me the strength to make it through,<br>
I'm giving every piece of me I have to you.<br>
<br>
Even tho I'm gone,<br>
you can see me standing there;<br>
You can hear me in the winds to come.<br>
I'll say "It's time to let go,<br>
you're never alone."<br>
Forever I'll be here...<br>
<br>
So goodbye for now!
Close your eyes and just believe in me;<br>
I'm always with you inside your heart.<br>
Just so you know,<br>
<br>
I'll find my way back home to you!<br>
<br>
I won't give up!<br>
Like heroes in a final fight.<br>
They may say that this is the end,<br>
but it's just begun!<br>
I will never stop fighting on!<br>
<br>
Goodbye for now.
